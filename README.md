# Welcome to Devmate!

Just like you, I do some tasks again and again. For that I have to fiddle through various options that Google Search provides me. The one simple example is convert unformatted JSON to formatted JSON. 

I have came across with such tools, compiling in the form of a Chrome extension called as Devmate. Overall it is your mate (a friend) who will assist you wherever it can.

> Please feel free to drop by your suggestions. In my spare time I will try to incorporate the same and make this extension useful for you.
